Here are the steps to calculate the present value of a future cash flow given the inputs:

Assumptions:
- The interest rate is the annual interest rate
- The total periods is the number of years

Steps:
1. Calculate the discount rate (r) by dividing the interest rate by 100: 
   r = Interest rate / 100
   r = 10% / 100 = 0.10

2. Calculate the number of compounding periods (n) per year. Since we are given annual data, there is 1 period per year.

3. Calculate the discount factor using the formula:
   Discount factor = 1 / (1 + r)^n
   Where: 
     r is the discount rate
     n is the number of periods
   Discount factor = 1 / (1 + 0.10)^5 
   Discount factor = 0.62092

4. Calculate the present value by multiplying the future value by the discount factor:
   Present value = Future value x Discount factor 
   Present value = $161.05 x 0.62092
   Present value = $100
