Okay, let me analyze this yield curve data:

- Comparing the short term yields (1 month, 3 month) to the long term yields (7 year, 10 year, 20 year, 30 year), I see that the yields are increasing as maturity lengthens. 

- The yield spread between the 10 year and 1 year is positive, at 2.74% - 2.09% = 0.65%. 

- The shape of the yield curve is upward sloping, with yields increasing as maturity lengthens. This is a normal upward sloping yield curve.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the macroeconomic scenario is one of economic expansion. The upward sloping yield curve suggests investors expect stronger economic growth and inflation in the future, leading to higher long term rates. The positive yield spread also signals expectations for higher future short term rates, consistent with economic expansion. Overall, this normal upward sloping yield curve points to expectations of economic expansion going forward.
