Here are the detailed steps for calculating the amortization schedule:

Assumptions:
- Monthly compounding of interest
- Fixed interest rate of 5.125% per year
- Loan term of 2 years (24 months)
- No balloon payment 

Calculations:

1) Determine monthly interest rate:
- Annual interest rate = 5.125% 
- Monthly interest rate = Annual rate / 12 months
             = 5.125% / 12 
             = 0.42708% per month

2) Calculate monthly payment:
- Loan amount = $20,000
- Number of monthly payments (n) = 24 months
- Monthly interest rate (i) = 0.42708%
- Monthly payment (PMT) = Loan amount x Monthly interest rate / (1 - (1 + Monthly interest rate)^(-Number of months))  
            = $20,000 x 0.42708% / (1 - (1 + 0.42708%)^(-24))
            = $877.92

3) Build amortization schedule:
- Beginning balance for month 1 = $20,000 (original loan amount)
- Interest for month 1 = Beginning balance x Monthly interest rate  
                          = $20,000 x 0.42708% = $85.42
- Principal for month 1 = Monthly payment - Interest  
                         = $877.92 - $85.42 = $792.50
- Ending balance for month 1 = Beginning balance - Principal 
                              = $20,000 - $792.50 = $19,207.50

- Repeat calculations for months 2 to 24 using ending balance from previous month as beginning balance.

- Total interest paid = Sum of monthly interest over 24 months 
                       = $1,067.08
