Period 1:
Cash flow = $90
Present value = $90 x 0.9420 = $84.78

Period 2:
Cash flow = $90
Present value = $90 x 0.8890 = $80.01

Period 3:
Cash flow = $90
Present value = $90 x 0.8573 = $77.16

Period 4:
Cash flow = $1090

Present value = $1090 x 0.8304 = $904.54

Sum the present values: $84.78 + $80.01 + $77.16 + $904.54 = $1146.49
Therefore, the present value of the future cash flows is $1146.49
