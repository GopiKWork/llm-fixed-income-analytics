To analyze the yield curve, take following actions 
* Compare yields of short terms (1 month, 3 month) with long term (more than 7 years). Are they increasing or decreasing?
* Analyze the yield spread between 10 year and 1 year and figure out if it is positive or negative.
* Figure out the shape of the yield curve

Based on the analysis, predict macro economic scenarios- expansion, recession or contraction.
Think step by step, analyze the shape of the curve upward or downward or flat.
