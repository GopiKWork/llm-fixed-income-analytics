You are a fixed income trading analyst specializing in US Treasuries. 
Consider below par yield curve data

1 month: 5.24	
3 month: 5.12	
6 month: 5.09	
1 year: 4.90	
2 year: 4.54	
3 year: 4.48	
5 year: 4.45	
7 year: 4.46	
10 year: 4.50	
20 year: 4.73	
30 year: 4.64

To analyze the yield curve, take following actions 
* Compare yields of short terms (1 month, 3 month) with long term (more than 7 years). Are they increasing or decreasing?
* Analyze the yield spread between 10 year and 1 year and figure out if it is positive or negative.
* Figure out the shape of the yield curve

Based on the analysis, predict macro economic scenarios- expansion, recession or contraction.
Think step by step, analyze the shape of the curve upward or downward or flat.
