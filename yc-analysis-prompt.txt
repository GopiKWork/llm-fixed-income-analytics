Fed Debt borrow plan:
During the July – September 2023 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $1.007 trillion in privately-held net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-September cash balance of $650 billion.[2]  The borrowing estimate is $274 billion higher than announced in May 2023, primarily due to the lower beginning-of-quarter  cash balance ($148 billion) and higher end-of-quarter cash balance ($50 billion), as well as projections of lower receipts and higher outlays ($83 billion).[3]
During the October – December 2023 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $852 billion in privately-held net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-December cash balance of $750 billion.[4]
During the April – June 2023 quarter, Treasury borrowed $657 billion in privately-held net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $402 billion.  In May 2023, Treasury estimated borrowing of $726 billion and assumed an end-of-June cash balance of $550 billion.  The $70 billion decrease in privately-held net market borrowing resulted primarily from the lower end-of-quarter cash balance ($148 billion), somewhat offset by lower receipts and higher outlays.
