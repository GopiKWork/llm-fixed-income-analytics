Here is my analysis and predicted yield curve for the next 12 months:

Analysis:

- The economy has been growing steadily the past few quarters, with GDP growth around 2-2.5%. Unemployment remains low at 3.6%. However, inflation has been persistently high, with the latest CPI reading at 2.97%. 

- The Fed has been aggressively raising rates to combat inflation, with the latest hike taking the fed funds rate to 5.4%. Market expectations are for at least one more 25bps rate hike. The Fed also began quantitative tightening to reduce its balance sheet.

- The yield curve has flattened significantly and could invert soon. The 10Y-1Y spread is now only 15bps. An inverted yield curve has preceded past recessions.

- Housing activity and manufacturing activity have slowed recently. Consumer sentiment has declined as well. However, consumer spending and the labor market remain strong for now. 

- The Treasury plans to continue ramping up debt issuance to finance government deficits. Increased bond supply is putting upward pressure on yields.

- There are increasing risks of an economic slowdown and potential recession in 2023 or 2024 due to tighter monetary policy, high inflation, weakening demand, and global growth concerns. A recession is not my base case but risks have risen. 

Predicted Treasury Yield Curve (for 1/3/2024):

1M: 5.25% 
3M: 5.50%
6M: 5.75% 
1Y: 6.00%
2Y: 6.25%
3Y: 6.00%
5Y: 5.50% 
7Y: 5.25%
10Y: 5.00% 
30Y: 5.25%

Computation:

- Started with current market rates across the curve 

- Incrementally increased short-term rates (up to 2 years) by 25bps each quarter over the next year to reflect additional Fed rate hikes

- Kept intermediate yields (2-7 years) relatively stable as rates are already quite high

- Gradually reduced longer-term yields (10-30 years) by 25-50bps as growth concerns put downward pressure 

- Yield curve inverts in the 2Y to 5Y portion as the Fed overtightens, signaling recession risk

- Curve inversion is mild given still strong labor market and consumer spending

- Long-end yields bottom out and rise slightly by year-end as inflation remains persistent 

In summary, I predict moderate Fed tightening to continue in 2023, causing an inversion of the yield curve. However, a mild recession is not my base case as the consumer remains resilient for now. The yield curve reflects recession concerns while terminal Fed rates limit how much long-end yields decline. Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of my analysis.
