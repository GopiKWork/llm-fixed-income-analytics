Here is a comprehensive analysis to determine an appropriate repo rate for the given transaction:

1. Benchmark Rate Influence: The general collateral (GC) repo rate of 0.25% provides a baseline reference point for determining the repo rate. However, since this security is considered "special", the repo rate will need to be above the GC rate to account for higher demand and lower supply of this specific treasury issue. 

2. Haircut: The 2% haircut will slightly decrease the repo rate compared to a transaction with no haircut. The haircut provides collateral protection for the cash lender. With less risk, a marginally lower repo rate is reasonable.

3. Market Liquidity: Given this issue is in high demand and deemed "special", market liquidity is low from the perspective of the cash borrower. Limited availability will push the repo rate higher to secure funding.

4. Term Structure Considerations: The inverted yield curve signals expectations of falling interest rates over the 60 day term. This will increase demand for longer dated bonds, further boosting demand for this special issue. The repo rate should account for this by shifting higher.

5. Credit Spread: With the security being US Treasury debt, credit risk is minimal. However, the macro environment of rising inflation and geopolitical tensions may warrant a small credit spread premium in the repo rate.

Taking all these factors into account, I would propose a repo rate of 0.60% for this transaction. This rate is well above the GC rate to account for the high demand and limited liquidity dynamics. It also provides a small premium for the inverted yield curve and economic uncertainties. The haircut allows for a slightly lower rate versus an unleveraged transaction. In summary, the proposed 0.60% repo rate reflects the specialness of the issue and current market conditions. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional considerations as I develop this recommendation.
