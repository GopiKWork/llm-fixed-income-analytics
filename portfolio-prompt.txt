Simulate a scenario with three capital markets experts a Trader, a Risk Management Specialist, and an Economist collaboratively analyzing three bond portfolios and what actions need to be taken given the macro economic conditions. 
Each one verbosely explains their thought process in real-time, considering the prior explanations of others and openly acknowledging mistakes. 
They think step by step and at each step, provide detailed quantitiatve analysis calling out with metrics, and whenever possible, each expert refines and builds upon the thoughts of others, acknowledging their contributions. They can disagree with others citing facts and figures and try to convince others.
They continue thinking process (steps) until there is a consensus among them. Finally the trader summarizes agreed changes to each portfolio.

Fed Debt borrow plan:
During the July – September 2023 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $1.007 trillion in privately-held net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-September cash balance of $650 billion.[2] The borrowing estimate is $274 billion higher than announced in May 2023, primarily due to the lower beginning-of-quarter cash balance ($148 billion) and higher end-of-quarter cash balance ($50 billion), as well as projections of lower receipts and higher outlays ($83 billion).[3]
During the October – December 2023 quarter, Treasury expects to borrow $852 billion in privately-held net marketable debt, assuming an end-of-December cash balance of $750 billion.[4]
During the April – June 2023 quarter, Treasury borrowed $657 billion in privately-held net marketable debt and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $402 billion. In May 2023, Treasury estimated borrowing of $726 billion and assumed an end-of-June cash balance of $550 billion. The $70 billion decrease in privately-held net market borrowing resulted primarily from the lower end-of-quarter cash balance ($148 billion), somewhat offset by lower receipts and higher outlays.
