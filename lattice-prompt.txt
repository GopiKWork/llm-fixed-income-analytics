You are a bond analyst. You are responsible to construct a binomial interest rate tree to find present value a bond. To construct the tree you will use the current market value of an option free US treasury bond and assume that it is fairly priced. Below provides inputs for the tree construction.

To build the interest rate tree, you have to calculate rates for all periods first and then values based on the rates. 

Rate calculation (forward):
* Start from the period 0 (current) and construct upto last period P
* Each period has period + 1 rates e.g. Period 0 has 1 rate, Period 2 has 3 rates, Period 3 has 4 rates
* Lowest rate for each period (P) is given as input (e.g. rate_01, rate_11). 
* To construct other rates, use the following formula  
rate_PN = rate_P1 * e^ (2 * N-1 * volatality) where N is from 2 to P+1 and P is the period number. e.g. 4th rate for 5th period is rate_54 = rate_51 * e^(2 * (3) * volatality)
* Rate for the last period is coupon rate
Repeat this until you reach last period Period P

Value calculation (backward):
* Start from period P and work backwards to calculate discounted values
* When period = maturity period (last period), discounted value is same as face
* value = discounted value + coupon e.g. value_21 = discounted_value_21 + coupon_21
* Take average of values for each rates at a given period. This is the value for this period. avg_value_1 = (value_11 + value_12)/2
* For other periods, use discounting method with the rate to calculate the present value
* Calculate discounted value of average value of next period discounted by rate. e.g. discounted_value_11 = avg_value_2/ (1+ rate_11)
Repeat this until you reach current period Period 0

Example tree:

Tree criteria:
rate_01: 3.5%
rate_11: 4.75%

No of time periods: 2
Time period interval: Yearly
Interest rate volatality: 10%

Bond:
Coupon rate: 4.2%
Face value: $100
Term to maturity: 2 years
Current market value: $97.8912

rates:
period:0
total rates = 0+1 = 1
rate_01 = 0.035

period:1
total rates = 1+1 = 2
rate_11 = 0.0475
rate_12 = rate_11 * e^ (2 * (2-1) * 0.1) = 0.058017

period:2 (Last period)
total rates = 2+1 = 3
rate_21 = coupon rate = 0.042 
rate_22 = coupon rate = 0.042
rate_23 = coupon rate = 0.042


values:
period:2
rate_21 = 0.042, discounted_value_21 = 100, coupon_21 = 4.2, value_21 = 104.2
rate_22 = 0.042, discounted_value_22 = 100, coupon_22 = 4.2, value_22 = 104.2
rate_23 = 0.042, discounted_value_23 = 100, coupon_23 = 4.2, value_23 = 104.2
avg_value_2= (104.2 + 104.2 + 104.2) /3 = 104.2

period:1
rate_11 = 0.0475, discounted_value_11 = avg_value_2/(1+ rate_11) = 99.475, coupon_11 = 4.2, value_11 = discounted_value_11 + coupon_11 = 103.675
rate_12 = 0.058017, discounted_value_12 = avg_value_2/(1+ rate_12) = 98.486, coupon_12 = 4.2, value_12 = discounted_value_12 + coupon_12 =102.686 
avg_value_1 = (103.675 + 102.686)/2 = 103.1805

period:0:  
rate_01 = 0.035, discounted_value_01 = 99.6913, coupon_01 = 0, value_01 = 99.6913
avg_value_0 = (99.6913)/1 = 99.6913


Construct a tree with with below criteria.

rate_11: 4.75%
rate_21: 5.01%

No of time periods: 3
Time period interval: Yearly

Term to maturity: 3 years
Current market value: $99.8912

To calculate the rates, you will do step by step. Each rate in time period need to be calculated. To calculate the discounted value you will do step by step. You calculate discounted value for each rate based on average value of next period.
