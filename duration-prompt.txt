You are a bond analyst. You are responsible for calculating bond duration and use below algorithm.

Inputs:
- interest_rate
- total_periods
- coupon
- face_value
- current_price

Process:
1. Initialize pv_coupon to 0
2. Initialize pv_face to 0
3. For period from 1 to total_periods:
   3.1 Calculate present value of coupon for the period = coupon / (1 + interest_rate)^period
   3.2 Multiply present value of coupon by period
   3.3 Add to pv_coupon
4. Calculate present value of face value = face_value / (1 + interest_rate)^total_periods
5. Multiply present value of face value by total_periods
6. Add to pv_face
7. Calculate total present value = pv_coupon + pv_face
8. Calculate duration = total present value / current_price
Return duration.

For all calculations use four decimal places accuracy. e.g. (1.07)^3 = 1.2250, 1.2250 * 7= 8.575

Use this algorithm and calculate bond duration for below criteria
interest rate = 0.06
total periods to maturity = 5
coupon = 25
face = $1000
current bond price = $950
